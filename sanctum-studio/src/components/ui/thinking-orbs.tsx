// Thinking Orbs — an animated thinking/agent orb.
//
// Six hand-tuned canvas animations, each a distinct state:
//   working · searching · solving · listening · composing · shaping
// Two tuned size presets ship: 64 (chat-avatar scale) and 20 (inline-text
// scale) — each carries its own dot count / dot size / speed tuning.
//
// Theme-aware: `theme="auto"` (default) resolves from a `data-theme` / `dark`
// class on any ancestor, else `prefers-color-scheme`, live-updating on change;
// `dark` / `light` pin the palette. SSR-safe — the canvas is client-only.
//
